# Siamese network on wester blot data

This network implements a Siamese network on western blot data. Parts of the siamese network were adapted from a repo on 
that was originally a jupyter notebook for facial similarity detection.

Running main.py will train the siamese network on the data and create a learning curve.

The parameters of the network need to be tuned for optimal performance.
